= Active Probe Forensics
:toc:

== Purpose

Drive Hyperglass + SmokePing + LibreSpeed/OpenSpeedTest from the CF-NDS forensics portal so we can contrast passive observations with deliberate probes across the OSI stack.

== Engines

* Hyperglass – BGP traceroute, ASN path checks, MTR-style jitter summaries.
* SmokePing – Persistent latency tracking (24h/7d/30d) with reference graphs.
* LibreSpeed – Self-hosted up/down/jitter engine that never talks to third parties.
* OpenSpeedTest – Optional browser-friendly backup engine for on-demand guest triage.

== Dashboard

Dashy or Heimdall hosts this stack with the “Midnight Security” theme:

* Header ticker – SNI/user-agent stream for spotting anomalies.
* Path map – GeoIP hops coloured red when a packet traverses unexpected regions.
* Port heatmap – 65k grid (or curated subset) highlighting active protocols.
* Health bar – Layered status that compares passive telemetry with active probe success.

== Security Hardening

* Centralise visibility behind Cloudflare WAF + API Shield, then expose via mTLS-protected Dashy/Heimdall.
* Lock probe runners so they cannot write directly to the Dashy backend without policy approval.
* Dashy health badges pulse when probe alerts fire, guiding SOC triage.

== Alert Conditions

* Jitter “spikes” (LibreSpeed/SmokePing) that exceed 10 ms or drift >20 % over baseline.
* Unexpected ASN or geo hops flagged by Hyperglass as part of the route map.
* Probe failure streaks that persist beyond configured retries drop markers into the HUD.
