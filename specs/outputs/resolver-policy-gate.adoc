= Resolver Policy Gate
:toc:
:toclevels: 2

== Purpose

All GraphQL resolvers are protected by a policy gate. Requests without a valid
A2ML‑attested entitlement policy are rejected before any resolver runs.

== Enforcement Order

1) Extract entitlement policy
2) Verify policy signature
3) Validate policy profile
4) Check module claims
5) Emit proof envelope

== Failure Mode

* Fail‑closed (deny by default)
* All decisions are logged with policy hash
