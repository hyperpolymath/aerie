= Alerting & Retention
:toc:
:toclevels: 2

== Purpose

Keep SmokePing/LibreSpeed/Hyperglass telemetry for months, link it to policy-gated alerting, and store every event in the VerisimDB audit trail.

== Retention

* Default retention: 90 days of bitemporal SmokePing/jitter graphs.
* Extended retention: 365+ days archived in compressed Arrow files with dedupe.
* VerisimDB federation exposes the same timeline to downstream analysts and policy scripts.

== Alerting

* Packet loss >5 % for three SmokePing intervals triggers a webhook/ntfy blast plus Dashy badge.
* Jitter spike (>10 ms over baseline) from LibreSpeed lights the “jitter pulse”.
* Hyperglass ASN divergence during a route hop raises a “Rogue path” alert and notifies the WAF guardrail.

== Delivery

* Hooks integrate with webhook bus (Slack, ntfy, PagerDuty) while respecting Svalinn maintenance windows.
* Alerts log each event in an Ed448-signed audit entry inside VerisimDB to prove immutability.
* Dashy/Heimdall surfaces unresolved alerts and provides “snapshot + acknowledgement” buttons for SOC playbooks.
