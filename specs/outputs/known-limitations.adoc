= Known Limitations & Guardrails
:toc:

== Purpose

Spell out the non-negotiable guardrails so teams understand which knobs are intentionally locked and why.

== Limitations

* **Relative bind mounts are disallowed.** Vörðr MCP canonicalises named volumes under the project root, so relative paths would escape the curated directory tree and break volume cleanup; use absolute paths or named volumes, and check the rejection logs if a compose file is rejected.
* **Secrets default to file mounts.** `SELUR_DEV_SECRETS=1` enables a noisy developer mode that prints warnings before injecting env vars; for production, mount secrets under `/run/secrets` so they never appear in logs.
* **Cloudflare automation runs are rate-limited.** Speedtest endpoints throttle bots, so CF-NDS exposes internal LibreSpeed/OpenSpeedTest hosts and policy-controlled API routes to stay reliable without hitting the CDN’s protection.
* **Spec outputs are auto-generated.** All `specs/outputs/*.adoc` files are regenerated through `just specs` (updates `manifest.sha256` and reapplies banners) and remain read-only; manual edits get rejected to prevent drift.

== Guardrails

* Run `just specs` whenever a component changes, then commit the updated manifest before pushing.
* Config validation (SELUR_DEV_SECRETS, volume checks) ensures drift from these limitations is logged and cannot silently slip into production.
* Known limitations are surfaced inside the Dashy “Known Issues” panel and referenced in the repository’s README/ROADMAP for visibility.
