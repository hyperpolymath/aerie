= Cyber-Focused Network Diagnostic Suite (CF-NDS)
:author: Project Lead
:status: Development

== Purpose

A high-assurance alternative to commercial speedtests. CF-NDS is designed to provide network engineers with the raw data required to diagnose routing interference, BGP hijacks, or ISP throttling without the privacy risks of third-party telemetry.

== Key Features

* Zero-telemetry speedtest: Powered by LibreSpeed, ensuring your metadata is not sold.
* BGP path visibility: Integrated Hyperglass instance for real-time routing forensics.
* Jitter persistence: SmokePing implementation to visualise link degradation over weeks, not seconds.
* Hardened access: Centralised behind a WAF with strict rate-limiting to prevent probe poisoning.

== Architecture (Secure Stack)

* **Verification chain**: Cerro Torre (bundle verification) → Svalinn (policy gate) → Vörðr (orchestration) → selur (IPC).
* **Data plane**: VerisimDB federation + VQL, ArangoDB for path/graph forensics, Dragonfly for realtime cache.
* **API plane**: GraphQL gateway with module-based entitlements and proof envelopes on every response.
* **Realtime**: WebSocket/SSE subscriptions (no RTSP) with per-module streams.

== Specs (K9 SVC)

See `specs/` for the bottom-up K9 components and rendered AsciiDoc outputs.

== Front-End Visual Layout

A high-density, SOC-style dashboard: a dark-mode forensics portal built on Dashy or Heimdall. Unlike a standard speedtest that provides one large number, this is a multi-widget HUD for rapid network triage.

== Security Note

This suite is intended for private deployment. Public exposure without the Phase 3 hardening (WAF/mTLS) is strictly discouraged to prevent external actors from mapping your internal routing.

== Standards

This programme's documentation and dialogue are maintained in Oxford British English.
