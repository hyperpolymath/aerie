= Roadmap: Advanced Network Forensics Suite
:revnumber: 1.4
:revdate: 2026-02-01

== Phase 0: Spec & Governance Foundation

[x] Bottom-up K9 specs system with guarded outputs.
[x] GraphQL schema outline with module-scoped subscriptions.
[x] Proof envelope spec (light/full) for all responses.
[x] Resolver policy gate and subscription auth flow.
[x] Bitemporal storage plan (valid-time + tx-time).
[x] OSI forensics matrix and HUD widgets.

== Phase 1: Core Telemetry & Containment

[x] Finalise Oxford British English documentation standards.
[x] Select toolchain: LibreSpeed (Speed), Hyperglass (Path), SmokePing (Stability).
[ ] Initial docker-compose.yml defining the "Forensics Bridge" network.
[ ] GraphQL gateway scaffold with policy gate (entitlements).

== Phase 2: Historical Integrity & Forensics

[ ] Implement SmokePing "Smoke" charts to identify 24h jitter patterns.
[ ] Configure Hyperglass nodes for multi-region path auditing.
[ ] Setup persistent Docker volumes for forensic log retention.
[ ] Wire VerisimDB temporal modality for bitemporal audit.

== Phase 3: Hardening & Shielding

[ ] Deploy Cloudflare API Shield to protect the diagnostic endpoints.
[ ] Integrate Ed448-signed logging for tamper-proof audit trails.
[ ] Implement mTLS (Mutual TLS) for dashboard access.

== Phase 4: Intelligence Dashboard

[x] Customise Dashy theme with "Midnight Security" aesthetic (HUD spec).
[x] Automated alerting via Webhooks for packet loss > 5% (policy hooks defined).

== Phase 4.5: Alerting, Retention & Guardrails

[x] Document Dashy alert badges, SmokePing retention tiers, and VerisimDB audit hooks.
[x] Publish known limitations for relative binds, secrets, automation throttles, and regen procedures.

== Phase 5: Passive Protocol Forensics

[ ] Deploy Zeek or Suricata in listen-only mode.
[ ] Map L4 flow data to realtime heatmap.
[ ] Implement L7 SNI sniffing for encrypted destinations.
[ ] Build OSI-layered status bar for the HUD.

== Phase 6: Proposed Architectural Enhancements

=== PAN (Personal Area Network) Enhancements: The "Last Meter"

[ ] **Bluetooth & BLE Monitoring Module:** Integrate a Bluetooth scanner to discover and monitor nearby PAN devices (headsets, IoT sensors), showing signal strength and latency in a new dashboard widget.
[ ] **USB Device Auditing:** Add a module to inventory connected USB devices and their bus status, helping to identify faulty hardware causing network-related issues.
[ ] **Wi-Fi Direct / Ad-hoc Network Analysis:** A module to detect and analyze local peer-to-peer networks used by services like screen mirroring.

=== LAN (Local Area Network) Enhancements: Mastering the Local Environment

[ ] **Physical Layer Topology Mapping (LLDP/CDP):** Implement a listener for LLDP/CDP to create a dynamic, interactive map of the physical network topology (e.g., which server is on which switch port).
[ ] **DHCP & DNS Server Auditing:** A module to actively monitor the health and response times of local DHCP and DNS servers.
[ ] **UPnP/SSDP Monitoring:** A security-focused widget that listens for and logs all UPnP and SSDP broadcasts to identify insecure devices opening ports.

=== MAN (Metropolitan Area Network) & WAN (Wide Area Network) Enhancements: Beyond the Edge

[ ] **Distributed Probes / "Aerie Agents":** Develop lightweight, secure probes for remote deployment in cloud VPCs or remote offices, enabling a full mesh of performance testing.
[ ] **Internet Weather & Major Outage Aggregation:** Integrate with public internet outage dashboards (e.g., Cloudflare Radar) to cross-reference local issues with global events.
[ ] **IXP (Internet Exchange Point) Path Analysis:** Enhance BGP path analysis to specifically identify and flag when traffic traverses major public IXPs.

=== Holistic & Security Enhancements

[ ] **Historical Network "Time Machine":** Implement a "Time Travel" mode in the UI, allowing the user to view the entire dashboard's state at any specific point in the past.
[ ] **SCADA/OT Network Monitoring Mode:** A "Passive-Only" mode that disables all active probes to allow for safe deployment in sensitive industrial environments.
[ ] **Post-Quantum Cryptography for Agents:** Use PQC algorithms (e.g., Kyber/Dilithium) for securing communication between the central Aerie instance and its distributed probes.
