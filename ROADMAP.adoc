= Roadmap: Advanced Network Forensics Suite
:revnumber: 1.4
:revdate: 2026-02-01

== Phase 0: Spec & Governance Foundation

[x] Bottom-up K9 specs system with guarded outputs.
[x] GraphQL schema outline with module-scoped subscriptions.
[x] Proof envelope spec (light/full) for all responses.
[x] Resolver policy gate and subscription auth flow.
[x] Bitemporal storage plan (valid-time + tx-time).
[x] OSI forensics matrix and HUD widgets.

== Phase 1: Core Telemetry & Containment

[x] Finalise Oxford British English documentation standards.
[x] Select toolchain: LibreSpeed (Speed), Hyperglass (Path), SmokePing (Stability).
[ ] Initial docker-compose.yml defining the "Forensics Bridge" network.
[ ] GraphQL gateway scaffold with policy gate (entitlements).

== Phase 2: Historical Integrity & Forensics

[ ] Implement SmokePing "Smoke" charts to identify 24h jitter patterns.
[ ] Configure Hyperglass nodes for multi-region path auditing.
[ ] Setup persistent Docker volumes for forensic log retention.
[ ] Wire VerisimDB temporal modality for bitemporal audit.

== Phase 3: Hardening & Shielding

[ ] Deploy Cloudflare API Shield to protect the diagnostic endpoints.
[ ] Integrate Ed448-signed logging for tamper-proof audit trails.
[ ] Implement mTLS (Mutual TLS) for dashboard access.

== Phase 4: Intelligence Dashboard

[x] Customise Dashy theme with "Midnight Security" aesthetic (HUD spec).
[x] Automated alerting via Webhooks for packet loss > 5% (policy hooks defined).

== Phase 4.5: Alerting, Retention & Guardrails

[x] Document Dashy alert badges, SmokePing retention tiers, and VerisimDB audit hooks.
[x] Publish known limitations for relative binds, secrets, automation throttles, and regen procedures.

== Phase 5: Passive Protocol Forensics

[ ] Deploy Zeek or Suricata in listen-only mode.
[ ] Map L4 flow data to realtime heatmap.
[ ] Implement L7 SNI sniffing for encrypted destinations.
[ ] Build OSI-layered status bar for the HUD.
